Setup
Install the current LTS version of Node.js
If you are using nvm (recommended) running nvm install will install the latest version and running nvm use will automatically choose the right node version for you.
Install Yarn v4 via Corepack
Run yarn install to install dependencies and run any required post-install scripts
Testing and Linting
Run yarn test to run the tests once. To run tests on file changes, run yarn test:watch.

Run yarn lint to run the linter, or run yarn lint:fix to run the linter and fix any automatically fixable issues.
